# The base spawn weight for Infernal mobs (1/N chance of a mob becoming Infernal)
# Higher value = lower probability (1/100 chance when set to 100)
# Min value: 1 (every mob becomes Infernal)
chance: 100

# Override spawn weights for specific mob types
mobChances:
  Ghast: 100

# Used to control how rare specific power levels are. (Uncomment to use)
# After a mob passes the above initial chance checks and has powers assigned, this is checked
# Format: '<number of abilities>: <weight>'
# Number of abilities of the mob are received from minPowers and maxPowers setting
# If the check fails, the mob will NOT become Infernal at all
#levelChance:
#  '3': 1  # Always accept mobs with 3 abilities (1/1 chance)
#  '4': 2  # 1/2 chance to keep mobs with 4 abilities
